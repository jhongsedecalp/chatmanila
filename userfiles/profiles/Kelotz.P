~OL~FR      If asked why I love her I would say
~OL~FW          Its the sway in her hips,
~OL~FR         the thickness in her thighs.
~OL~FW          Its the lust in her lips,
~OL~FR            the love in her eyes.
~OL~FW        Its the softness of her skin,
~OL~FR             the silk in her hair
~OL~FW         Its the twist in her walk;
~OL~FR       its the sweetness in her talk.
~OL~FW         Its the way she loves me
~OL~FR       that makes me love her each day.
~OL~FW          That is what I would say.
